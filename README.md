# ReactCourse

Mini Project #2
---------------

### Simple React Boilerplate

After building a simple React app in the first React Course mini project, we
have extracted webpack and express server configuration, along with file
structure, into the React boilerplate directory.

This boilerplate can be used to get started quicker with the new React projects.

After cloning this project run `npm install` in your command line and to start a
server run `node server.js`. To get updates without restarting `node` server
every time, run `webpack -w` in the separate command line tab before starting
`node` server.
